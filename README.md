- Local processing only
- Temporary test data only
- Secure network communication

## Build Configuration

### Shared Package
```swift
// Package.swift
platforms: [
    .iOS(.v16),
    .macOS(.v13), 
    .tvOS(.v16),
    .watchOS(.v9)
]
```

### Conditional Compilation
Platform-specific features use conditional compilation:
```swift
#if os(iOS)
// iOS-specific code
#elseif os(macOS)
// macOS-specific code
#elseif os(tvOS)
// tvOS-specific code
#elseif os(watchOS)
// watchOS-specific code
#endif
```

## Usage

### Server Mode
1. Launch the app on the server device
2. Select "‰º∫ÊúçÂô®Á´Ø" (Server Mode)
3. Tap "ÂïüÂãï‰º∫ÊúçÂô®" (Start Server)
4. Note the displayed IP address
5. Wait for client connections

### Client Mode
1. Launch the app on the client device
2. Select "ÂÆ¢Êà∂Á´Ø" (Client Mode)
3. Enter the server IP address or select from discovered servers
4. Tap "ÈÄ£Á∑ö‰∏¶Ê∏¨Ë©¶" (Connect and Test)
5. View real-time progress and final results

### Results Interpretation
- Speed results are displayed in MB/s
- Performance rating provides context for the speed
- Suggestions help optimize network performance
- Results can be shared or exported (platform-dependent)

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests:
- Core networking functionality
- Speed calculation accuracy
- Performance rating evaluation
- Configuration management
- Error handling

Run tests with:
```bash
